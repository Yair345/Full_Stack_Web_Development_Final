## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused or modified
3. **Testing**: Easier to write unit tests for individual components
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
5. **Performance**: Smaller components allow for better optimization
6. **Readability**: Much easier to understand and navigate

## Usage

The main entry point is still `pages/Transactions.jsx` which simply exports the default from `./Transactions/index.jsx`, maintaining backward compatibility with existing imports.
